I need to get rid of the crazy distances.  And is there a weird stripe of stars at mag<4?
use parallax distance (with error) from http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/hipparcos.html

Dark (black) background.  Each star is a transparent White/yellow circles.
The galaxy is a (series of?) oblong ellipses, and a circle in the middle for the bulge.
Earth is left side of screen, galactic center is right side.

A typical distance is a few hundred light-years.  This means that the light you're seeing today was emitted a few hundred years ago, say in the 1600s.

Eventually, make a user interface to toggle between different settings (limiting magnitudes):
mag<3 middle of a big city
mag<4 suburbia
mag<5 small town
mag<6 100 miles from nowhere
mag<7 1000 miles from nowhere

At what point are you starting to see out to the thickness of the disk?  That's pretty cool!
Well, if the distribution isn't spherical, this means you're seeing the disk at some level.

Wow: http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/stars/
(although it doesn't give you a sense of how far you can see with the naked eye.)
